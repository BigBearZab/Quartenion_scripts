# Quartenion_scripts
University masters quarternion scripts in Python 2

Designed for use to assess and rotate crystals within finite element analysis models. The use of quarternions eliminates multiple solutions to rotation matrices when solving, therefore eliminates model ambiguits.

The scripts would then parse in crystalography data from TEM and allow for analysis of distribution. 

Alternately this could also be used with a random generator to create random crystal distributions for use with FEA analysis.
